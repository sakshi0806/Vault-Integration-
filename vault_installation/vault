Vault Integration Guide
Step 1: Install Vault

Download Vault from https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/install.
Extract the binary and move it to a directory in your PATH.
Verify installation: vault --version.
Step 2: Start Vault Server

Initialize and start the Vault server in development mode for testing:

vault server -dev
Note the root token displayed in the terminal (used for initial setup).
Step 3: Set Up Vault Environment

Set the environment variable to communicate with Vault:

export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
Authenticate with the root token:

vault login <root_token>
Step 4: Enable Secrets Engine

Enable a secrets engine (e.g., key/value store):

vault secrets enable -path=secret kv
Step 5: Store and Retrieve Secrets

Store a secret:

vault kv put secret/my-secret my-value=s3cr3t
Retrieve a secret:

vault kv get secret/my-secret
Step 6: Configure Vault for Your Application

Create policies to control access:

vault policy write my-policy - <<EOF
path "secret/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}
EOF
Create a token with the policy:
vault token create -policy="my-policy"
  
Use the token in your application to authenticate and access Vault.
Step 7: Integrate Vault with Your Application

Add Vault client libraries to your application.
Use the token to authenticate and retrieve secrets programmatically.
